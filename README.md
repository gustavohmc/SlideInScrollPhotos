# SlideInScrollPhotos
the images on the page will scroll in from the sides when scrolling reaches their position.
Part of Javascript30.com. I've changed some things to make it more personal.

The trick is to define the height when the image should start showing, and then add a class to make it visible.
It works from the bottom up as well. The image will also slide out when the window scrolls past it's position.
